# Health Analytics Page Fix Report

## 🔍 **Issues Identified and Resolved**

### 1. **Missing Tabs Configuration**
**Issue**: The `tabs` array was referenced but not defined in the main index.jsx file.
**Fix**: Added proper tabs configuration with Crop Health and Worker Wellness tabs.

```jsx
const tabs = [
  {
    id: 'crop-health',
    label: 'Crop Health',
    icon: 'Leaf'
  },
  {
    id: 'worker-wellness',
    label: 'Worker Wellness',
    icon: 'Heart'
  }
];
```

### 2. **Incompatible CSS Classes**
**Issue**: Components were using Tailwind opacity modifiers (e.g., `bg-success/10`, `hover:bg-primary/90`) that weren't compatible with the enhanced CSS system.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/pages/health-monitoring-analytics/index.jsx`
- `src/pages/health-monitoring-analytics/components/WorkerWellnessTab.jsx`
- `src/pages/health-monitoring-analytics/components/CropHealthTab.jsx`
- `src/pages/health-monitoring-analytics/components/HealthAlerts.jsx`

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced `bg-success/10` with `status-success` class
- Replaced `bg-primary/10` with `status-info` class
- Replaced `bg-warning/10` with `status-warning` class
- Replaced `bg-error/10` with `status-error` class
- Replaced custom button classes with enhanced button components (`btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-danger`)
